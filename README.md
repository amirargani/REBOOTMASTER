## Overview 🛠️  
REBOOTMASTER is a powerful monitoring service specifically designed to ensure the continuous availability of critical applications. It constantly tracks the status of configured services and responds immediately if any of them stop unexpectedly. In such cases, REBOOTMASTER automatically restarts the affected service to minimize downtime and maintain high system availability. With its proactive monitoring and recovery capabilities, REBOOTMASTER is an essential tool for maintaining a stable and reliable IT infrastructure.

## Note 📌  
A service is a program or process that runs in the background and performs tasks. Downtime refers to periods when a service is unavailable or non-functional. This can occur due to maintenance, technical issues, or unexpected errors. During downtime, users cannot access or use the affected services.

## Recommendation 💡  
Please ensure you consult with your software developer regarding the use of this software, if necessary.
